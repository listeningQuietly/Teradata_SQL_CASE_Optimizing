/*
Use a case statement to sort through 3 Attributes.
Pros:
  1) The structure is exceedingly simple to understand.
  2) The order of the WHENs doesn't matter.
Cons:
  1) The conditionals and outputs are NOT simple to maintain because of their data type.
  2) The O-runtime is also suboptimal because evaluation on all attributes is performed every WHEN.
