/*
Q: Use CASE statements to segment rows across three independent traits (Attribute_1, Attribute_2, and Attribute_3) that only include values of 0s and 1s while ignoring the all 0s segment.
A: 3 Attributes with only 2 values is 8 (2^3) segments -1 for the all 0s. 7 segments * 3 operations = 21 operations total. Here is the simplest way to sort them. 
Pros:
  1) The structure is exceedingly simple to understand.
  2) The order of the WHENs doesn't matter.
Cons:
  1) The conditionals and outputs are NOT simple to maintain because of their data type.
  2) The O-runtime is also suboptimal because evaluations on all attributes is performed every WHEN.
