# Teradata_SQL_CASE_Optimizing

It is often that as a specialist, I see data problems coming. Sometimes the customer has the budget to prevent it, but more often, they reply 'that is not within scope today.' Which is fair, but that does not really stop me from thinking about how to solve or even prevent issues entirely.

While answering a series of interview questions, I realized that one of the problems stood out. It was quite different. I had to tinker and think over solutions after testing a bit. And it was probably the best technical interview question I have every had because it was more than a knowledge check. It stuck with me so much, I want to share the evolution of my solutions.
