/*
Use a case statement to sort through 3 Attributes more efficiently.
Pros:
  1) The O-runtime is more optimal because fewer conditionals are evaluated per WHEN on average.
  2) The conditionals and outputs are simpler to maintain.
  3) The structure is simple enough to understand.
  4) The order of WHENs with the same number of conditionals does not matter.
Cons:
  1) The order of the WHENs matters and generally requires the more complex WHENs earlier than their simpler counterparts to maintain accuracy.
Update: Traded WHEN order simplicity for significantly faster runtime and some data type protections (disallows string issues).
