/*
Use a case statement to sort through 3 Attributes more efficiently.
Pros:
  1) The structure is simple enough to understand.
  2) The conditionals and outputs are simpler to maintain.
Cons:
  1) The order of the WHENs matters and generally requires the more complex WHENs earlier than their simpler counterparts to maintain accuracy.
  2) The O-runtime is less suboptimal because evaluation of only a few attributes is performed every WHEN, but this is not as efficient as possible.
Update: Traded WHEN order simplicity for significantly faster runtime (less evaluations per WHEN) and some data type protections (disallows string issues).
