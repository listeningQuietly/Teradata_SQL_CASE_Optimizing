/*
Use a case statement to sort through 3 Attributes more efficiently.
Pros:
  1) The O-runtime is now optimal because case statements only evaluation once per attribute.
  2) The favoring of the evalutions (Attribute_1, Attribute_2, or Attribute_3) no longer matters.
Cons:
  1) The structure is complex.
  2) Does this run accurately if there are non- 0 or 1 values present? Yes.
     Can this withstand NULLs? Yes.
Update: Traded a complex structure for fastest O-runtime.
