/*
Q: Same as before.
A: Use CASE statements to sort through combinations of 3 Attributes *most* efficiently.
Pros:
  1) The runtime is now completely optimized because the maximum number of conditionals evaluated is the same as the number of attributes (12/7 => 3/7).
  2) The favoring of the combinations (Attribute_1 over Attribute_2 over Attribute_3) is eliminated.
Cons:
  1) The structure is complex to expand.
Summary Update: Traded a complex structure that required constant maintenance for syntax that is challenging to expand, but doesn't favor an attribute, does not require constant reworking, and does have the fastest runtime possible.
