/*
Q: Use CASE statements to segment rows across three independent traits (Attribute_1, Attribute_2, and Attribute_3) that only include values of 0s and 1s while ignoring the all 0s segment.
A: Use CASE statements to sort through combinations of 3 Attributes most efficiently (Final Version).
Pros:
  1) The runtime is now completely optimized because the maximum number of conditionals evaluated is the same as the number of attributes (12/8 => 3/8).
  2) The maintenance costs spent reworking the syntax to maintain advantage are eliminated because the combination bias (Attribute_1 over Attribute_2 over Attribute_3) is eliminated.
Cons:
  1) The syntax is tedious to expand.

Summary Update: Traded complex, biased syntax that requires constant maintenance for syntax that is tedious to expand, but will always have the fastest runtime possible and also does not require constant reworking.
