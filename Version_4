/*
Q: Use CASE statements to segment rows across three independent traits (Attribute_1, Attribute_2, and Attribute_3) that only include values of 0s and 1s while ignoring the all 0s segment.
A: Use CASE statements to sort through combinations of 3 Attributes most efficiently.
Pros:
  1) The runtime is now completely optimized because the maximum number of conditionals evaluated is the same as the number of attributes (12/7 => 3/7).
  2) The favoring of the combinations (Attribute_1 over Attribute_2 over Attribute_3) is eliminated.
Cons:
  1) The structure is complex and therefore difficult to expand and maintain.
Update: Traded a complex structure for fastest O-runtime.
