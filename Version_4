/*
Use a case statement to sort through 3 Attributes most efficiently.
Pros:
  1) The O-runtime is now optimized because the maximum number of conditionals evaluated is the same as the number of attributes.
  2) The favoring of the combinations (Attribute_1 over Attribute_2 over Attribute_3) does not matter.
Cons:
  1) The structure is complex.
Update: Traded a complex structure for fastest O-runtime.
