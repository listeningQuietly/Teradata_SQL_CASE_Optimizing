/*
Use a case statement to sort through 3 Attributes more efficiently.
Pros:
  1) The O-runtime is more optimal because WHEN statements with fewer conditionals are performed earlier.
Cons:
  1) The structure is deceptively simple because order matters significantly more than previously and is dependent on data if it is a runtime upgrade.
     This version favors Attribute_1 over Attribute_2 and Attibute_2 over Attribute_3.
Update: Traded simplicity of order for significantly faster O-runtime.
