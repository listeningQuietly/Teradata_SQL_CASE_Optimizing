/*
Q: Using CASE statements to segment rows across three independent traits (Attribute_1, Attribute_2, and Attribute_3) that only include values of 0s and 1s while ignoring the all 0s segment.
A: Use case statements to sort through combinations of 3 Attributes even more efficiently.
Pros:
  1) The runtime is slgihtly more optimized because WHEN statements with fewer conditionals are performed earlier.
Cons:
  1) The structure is deceptively simple because order matters significantly more than previously and is dependent on the data if it is consistently an upgrade.
     This version favors combinations with Attribute_1 before the others, with Attibute_2 before Attribute_3, and then Attribute_3.
Update: Traded simplicity of order for slightly faster runtime.
