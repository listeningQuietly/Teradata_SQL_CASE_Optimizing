/*
Use a case statement to sort through 3 Attributes more efficiently.
Pros:
  1) The O-runtime is more optimal because WHEN statements with fewer conditionals are performed earlier.
Cons:
  1) The structure is deceptively simple because order matters significantly more than previously and is dependent on the data if it is consistently a runtime upgrade.
     This version favors combinations with Attribute_1 before the others, with Attibute_2 before Attribute_3, and then Attribute_3.
Update: Traded simplicity of order for significantly faster O-runtime.
